## Abstract

A Fuzzy Petri Net (FPN) is proposed to be used for the representation of knowledge in the form of fuzzy production rules. Single Literal Resolution Rules and a Partition Rule have been proposed for making inferences from the fuzzy knowledge and for theorem proving using FPN. An algorithm has been proposed to perform automated fuzzy reasoning.
